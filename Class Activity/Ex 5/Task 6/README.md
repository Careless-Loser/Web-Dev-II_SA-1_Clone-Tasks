## Key HTML Tags and Elements Used

1. Document Structure
An HTML document consists of the html, head, and body tags:

<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
     Body content goes here
</body>
</html>

- **html**: The root element of an HTML page.
- **head**: Contains metadata about the document, including the title.

2. Header and Navigation Bar
The header and nav tags create a structured navigation area at the top of the page:

<header>
    <nav>
        <a href="#home">Home</a>
        <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
    </nav>
</header>

3. Section and Article
The section and article tags encapsulate content relevant to a specific topic:

<section>
    <article>
        <h1>My Article</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>This is a quote.</blockquote>
    </article>
</section>

        <figcaption>This is my image.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</aside>

- **aside**: Represents content related to the main content but could be considered separate.
- **figure**: Used to encapsulate content such as images along with their captions.
- **img**: Displays an image; requires the src attribute for the image source and alt for accessibility.
- **figcaption**: Provides a caption for the content within the figure.

        <input type="email" placeholder="Your Email">
        <input type="submit">
    </form>
