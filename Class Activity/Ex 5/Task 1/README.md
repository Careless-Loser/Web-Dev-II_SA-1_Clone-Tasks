 # HTML5 Refresher README

## Overview
This project serves as a refresher for the fundamentals of HTML5. 

It covers the basic building blocks of an HTML document, introduces new HTML5 tags, and demonstrates how to structure a webpage effectively. 

The tutorial walks through creating a simple webpage with sections such as headers, navigation bars, articles, side content, and footers using semantic HTML5 tags.

## Key Features of HTML5
- **Semantic Elements**: HTML5 introduces tags like header, footer, article, and section that help structure web content semantically.
- **Multimedia Support**: Elements like figure and figcaption allow better media handling.
- **Form Enhancements**: New input types like number, date, and color make creating forms easier.
- **Improved Accessibility**: HTML5 ensures better accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) with well-defined content structures.

## HTML5 Example
## Here is a basic structure of an HTML5 document:

<html>
<head>
  <title>My Test Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Test Web Page</h1>
  </header>

  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>

  <article>
    <h2 id="section1">This is Section 1</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph in section 1.</p>

    <h2 id="section2">This is Section 2</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph in section 2.</p>

    <h2 id="section3">This is Section 3</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph in section 3.</p>
  </article>

  <aside>
    <h3>About the Author</h3>
    <p>This is some information about the author of this webpage.</p>
  </aside>

  <footer>
    <p>Â© 2024 Author Name</p>
  </footer>

</body>
</html>

## Project Instructions
- **Create an HTML Document**: Start by declaring the document type (DOCTYPE html) and adding the html, head, and body tags.

- **Add a Header**: Use the header tag to create a heading for the webpage.

- **Create a Navigation Bar**: Inside the nav tag, create a list of links using ul, li, and a tags.

- **Write an Article**: Use the article tag for the main content and section it using h2, p tags.

- **Include Side Content**: Add complementary information in the aside tag.

- **Footer**: End the webpage with the footer tag for additional information like author name and copyright.

## Additional Tags Overview
- **Structural Tags**: header, footer, section, article, and <aside> define different parts of a webpage.

- **Media Tags**: Use figure and figcaption for images and captions.

- **Forms**: HTML5 improves form handling with new input types (e.g., date, color).

## To-Do Project
- Create a small webpage using the following sections:

Header
Navigation bar
Article content
Side content (aside)
Footer
Each section must use the appropriate HTML tags as demonstrated in the tutorial.

## Scoring Criteria
- **Correctness of HTML structure**: 5/10
- **Appropriate usage of HTML tags**: 5/10
