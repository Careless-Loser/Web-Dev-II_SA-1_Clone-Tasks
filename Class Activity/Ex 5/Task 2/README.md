## HTML Document Structure README

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple HTML document with a specific structure, demonstrating the fundamental concepts of HTML. 

The webpage will display a title, link to an external stylesheet, show a paragraph of text, include an image, and provide a hyperlink.

## Key Concepts
- **HTML Document Structure**: Understanding the division of an HTML document into its head and body sections is crucial for organizing content and metadata.

- **External Stylesheets**: HTML allows linking to external CSS files for styling the webpage, separating content from design.

- **Images and Links**: Adding media and interactivity to a webpage is accomplished using img and a tags.

##HTML Example
Below is a basic structure of an HTML document created for this project:

---

<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Webpage</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text on my first HTML5 webpage!</p>
  <img src="https://www.example.com/image.jpg" alt="My first image">
  <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
</body>
</html>

### Key Elements:
- **HTML Tags**: The html, head, and body tags form the basic structure of the HTML document.
