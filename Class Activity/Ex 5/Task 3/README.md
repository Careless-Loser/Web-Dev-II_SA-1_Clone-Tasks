# Working with Text in HTML5 

## Overview

This project involves creating a simple webpage using HTML5. The webpage includes a header that says "Welcome to my page", paragraph, sub-header, an ordered list of reasons why I love the hobby, and a blockquote of a famous saying or quote related to the hobby, emphasize one word in the paragraph and one word in the list & make one word in the header strong. 
The objective is to use various HTML elements correctly while ensuring the page is well-structured and formatted.

## Key Concepts and Elements

Every HTML document follows a specific structure, starting with DOCTYPE html, which declares the document type. Inside the html tag, two main sections exist:

---

- **Head Section**: Contains metadata like the title of the webpage.

---

- **Body Section**: Contains all the visible content, such as text, headings, and lists.

---

- **Headings**: h1 to h6 tags define headings of different levels, with h1 being the most important and h6 being the least.
**Example**:<br>
**h1 Welcome to strong My /strong Page /h1**

---

- **Paragraphs**: The p tag defines a paragraph of text.
**Example**:<br>
**p My favorite hobby is em photography /em. I enjoy capturing the beauty of the world around me. /p**

---

- **Emphasizing Text**:
**em** is used to emphasize text, often rendering it italic.
**strong** is used to denote strong importance, often rendering text bold.
**Example**:
** strong My /strong in the heading and em photography /em in the paragraph.**

---

- **Lists**:

Unordered (ul) and ordered (ol) lists allow structured content.

**Example**:
- **Ordered List**:
<ol>
  <li>It allows me to express my creativity.</li>
  <li>I can capture <em>memorable</em> moments.</li>
  <li>It's a relaxing activity.</li>
</ol>

- **Unordered List**:
<ul>
  <li>It allows me to express my creativity.</li>
  <li>I can capture <em>memorable</em> moments.</li>
  <li>It's a relaxing activity.</li>
</ul>

---

- **Blockquote**:
The <blockquote> tag is used for block-level quotations, setting apart large quotes from the main text.
**Example**:

<blockquote>"Photography is the story I fail to put into words." - Destin Sparks</blockquote>
